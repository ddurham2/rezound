 * This is a queue of memory which will do blocked reads and writes
 * I would prefer to use a the pipe() system call, but I need a specific
 * pipe size.  It is meant to be used by 2 threads, one reading from and
 * one writing to the pipe.  All the pertinent methods are thread-safe
 *
 * The type template parameters must be a type who's instantiations can
