 *	- It uses a progressing window of past samples to calculate an RMS (root-mean-square which is sqrt((s1^2 + s2^2 + ... Sn^2)/N) ) versus using a normal average or 'mean'
 *	- The windowTime given at construction is in samples not seconds
 *	- It is often necessary to initialize the object with 'windowTime' samples before even using the value from readLevel()
 *		- To do this, simply call readLevel() for the first 'windowTime' samples in the audio stream
