#if 0 // no no, wait a minute.. I'm going to try to let there be definitions of the number of octaves on the frontend widget
/*
	I have to make this define because:
	On the frontend widget, to be 'industry standard' I want to make the 
	horizontal axis have octaves at equally spaced intervals and with a
	lowest base frequency at the far left.  Secondly, for presets in the
	frontend to work, I don't need the preset to affect sounds differently
	that simply have different sampling rates.  So, I should not make it
	so that the right most edge of the frontend widget represents the 
	sampleRate/2 for what sample is being filtered.

	Hence, I define this value below to be the highest frequency that 
	one would work with.
