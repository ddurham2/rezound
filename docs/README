- the $REZ_SHARE_DIR environment variable, if set, can be used to override the install_dir_prefix/share/ReZound path
	where install_dir_prefix is normally /usr or /usr/local

	So if you ran configure as: `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ...` but had later 
	copied the ReZound installed files all into your home directory under a 
	directory called "ReZound" (i.e. /home/ddurham/ReZound) then you can override
	ReZound looking in /usr/local/ReZound for presets.dat by issuing:

		export REZ_SHARE_DIR=/home/ddurham/ReZound

	at the prompt before running ReZound.
	

- Gotcha - 
	A while back I had loaded a file from a cdrom then exited the program and 
	ejected the CD.  Well, on exit ReZound remembers the last location that you 
	opened a file.  So, the next time that I ran ReZound it tried to verify
	that last-opened path and hung the application for about 10 seconds and 
	then finally came up.  After loading a file from a different location the
	next time ReZound started up fine.  Otherwise, you can edit 
	~/.rezound/registry.dat and just remove the 'promptDialogDirectory' line.
