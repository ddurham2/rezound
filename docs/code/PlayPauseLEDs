The playing and paused LED indicators are implemented with triggers... CSoundPlayerChannel has a 
means of allowing the front end sound window to register to get a function called when playing and 
pausing starts and stops, the handler functions should simply check the isPlaying or isPaused flag 
to know why the trigger was tripped

This trigger mechanism is implemented with the CTrigger class which simply has a trip function and
handler registration functions.  It also has a user data pointer given to CTrigger's constructor 
that is passed to the handler function when the trigger is tripped.
	- ??? I suppose CTrigger could be a template so the type of that user data could be known
