This is a todo list for things we need to do for an official release. In
other words, it's what we'll want to change between the svn sources and a
distro tarball(eg: removing warning flags)

1. Revise docs/AUTHORS to give proper credit, and only list files included in final release. Might want to save separate version to keep in CVS.

2. Revise docs/NEWS and docs/Features.txt (use `e.g. svn2cl -i -r "HEAD:r1961"` to determine what significant things have changed since the previous release)

3. Update the version number in CMakeLists.txt and docs/INSTALL

4. PROOF-READ ALL CHANGES YOU JUST MADE!

--- EITHER -------------

7. update the rpm spec file

8. rebuild FOX with all the possible --disable flags, --with-opengl=no, and probably CPPFLAGS=-DNO_XIM
	CPPFLAGS=-DNO_XIM configure --with-opengl=no --disable-jpeg --disable-png --disable-tiff --disable-zlib --disable-bz2lib
	- Sometimes fox needs --disable-shared with gcc-3.2 on some platforms to make the rezound FOX test succeed [linking issues]

--- OR -----------------
# TODO revise for CPack instructions

8. rebuild FOX with all the possible --disable flags, --with-opengl=no, and probably CPPFLAGS=-NO_XIM then 'make_standalone.sh'
9. create .rpm as standalone
	- update the rpm spec file
	- copy the source tarball to /usr/src/RPM/SOURCES
	- rpmbuild -ba rezound.spec

------------------------

11. checkin any modified files (docs/AUTHORS, docs/NEWS, docs/Features.txt, configure.in, docs/INSTALL, etc)

12. get .deb from Anthony

13. Make a svn release tag (but check in any files that may have been changed first)
	- svn copy trunk tags/rezound-1_2_3alpha

14. announce:
	- make release on sourceforge.net
	- add a news blurb in the news section at sourceforge
	- freshmeat.net
	- demudi, demudi-devel, portaudio, FOX, ReZound, linux-audio-dev, jackit-devel, etc  mailing lists
		- make sure to put a description in the mailing list so people know what it is
