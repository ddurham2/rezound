--- TODOs (for a user to be most concerned about) ordered from most serious to least serious ---

- I have not imeplemented 'redo' yet, but provisions are mostly in place for implementing it.

- The 'Delay' effect is implemented to be much more powerful but there needs to be an advanced front end dialog to take advantage of this greater flexibility of the implementation

- There is a slight drawing bug in which the the area on screen which is selected is drawn shifted to the left just slightly
	- I always zoom in to make selections which are that important to get just exactly right

- As more experienced users make suggestions, there will probably be changes to how the frontend dialogs express units and ranges of parameters to the effect and edit actions
	- This is aimed at making the frontend controls act and feel more like professional hardware products

- The author of FOX (the frontend library) says that skinning/theming is a real possibility, and does plan to implement it sometime in the future.
