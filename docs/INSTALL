ReZound 0.13.0beta Installation instructions 

TODO -- shorten this up.. at least have a quick read section at the top.. exampling how to use cmake configuration varaibles

REQUIRED OR RECOMMENDED LIBRARIES AND APPLICATIONS:

Before attempting to build ReZound you will need to have (or are encouraged to have) the following:

1. Compiler:
	- cmake -- ReZound uses cmake for platform detection and generating build files.

	- gcc -- ReZound was originally developed using gcc/g++.  A typical system will be set up for
	cmake to find gcc/g++ automatically and use it.

	- clang -- effort has been made to support compiling against clang/clang++.  To compile using
	clang, some cmake variables may need to be set before running configure:
		
		cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ...

2. Libraries: 

	- libaudiofile v0.2.3 (or later) -- http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/ --
	Development was done with v0.2.3, but earlier versions above than v0.1.9-0.1 
	may work as well. audiofile is available on most distributions. 

	- libfox v1.0.0 (or later) -- http://www.fox-toolkit.org/ -- The FOX GUI 
	toolkit, (earlier version may work)
		- NOTE: reswrap comes with fox.  If you install from the fox tarball
			then you should not have any problems.  If your distro's fox
			package is split into more than 1 package, then you made need
			to install the package containing the reswrap executable.

	- libfftw v3.0.0 (or later) -- http://www.fftw.org -- This is required for 
	convolution filtering, arbitrary FIR filtering, the frequency analyzer, etc.

	- lame v3.92 (or later) -- http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3 -- It is recommended that 
	you have lame installed because it provides ReZound with the ability to load and 
	save .mp3 files.  Some distros name the package: 'notlame'.

	- cdrdao -- http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/ -- This is require for the "Burn to CD"
	action

	- libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile and libvorbisenc -- http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ 
	These are required for loading and saving .ogg files

	- libFLAC, libFLAC++ -- http://flac.sourceforge.net/ -- These are required for loading
	and saving FLAC files

	- libSoundTouch -- http://www.surina.net/soundtouch/ This library is required for 
	the the actions that change pitch without changing tempo and that change tempo without 
	changing pitch.

	- libasound2 -- This is the ALSA library so that audio I/O can use ALSA.

	- libpulseaudio -- (often libpulse-dev) This can be used to use the pulseaudio daemon 
	for sound output

	- libportaudio -- http://www.portaudio.com -- This can be used if you know what you're
	doing and need it for some reason.

	- libjack -- http://jackit.sourceforge.net -- This can be used to enable JACK 
	support.  JACK is a really nice system where the jackd server runs and JACK 
	enabled applications connect to it.  Then you can route audio between applications
	instead of being limited in that applications alway do I/O with the hardware device 
	itself.

	- vox/devox -- http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~tim/vox/ -- required if you want to load 
	.vox files.  This seems to be a quite obscure format, so support would be for 
	rather few people I think.  THESE TWO ARE APPLICATIONS, NOT LIBRARIES


3. You should also have a working C++ compiler (g++ is preferred) as well as the 
normal group of regular libraries and headers for compiling packages. 


4. bison -- This is required for building the config file parser.

5. flex -- (free-lex) This is commonly installed, but there should be a package 
for your distro.  I have not tried building ReZound using lex.



See the end of this file for information on configure options specific to
ReZound.

If you encounter any errors in the build process and you think you have all the 
required libraries, please send a bug report to: 
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=105056&group_id=5056

If at all possible try to send details, preferably a screen dump or script file.

# REMOVED To build a stand alone binary use the configure flag: --enable-standalone.  However,
# this requires having all the static libraries that may be depended on by ReZound's 
# dependancies (i.e. FOX depends on libjpeg, libpng, libtiff, etc, so libjpeg.a, 
# libpng.a, libtiff.a, etc would be required to link.  But that is, only if FOX was not 
# configured with --disable-... flags to remove FOX's depenance on these libs.)
