#	make this recompute the list of source files, use xgettext to scan for strings, and rebuild rezound.pot.. then cmake should only need to compute the .gmo files (within the shadow dir) and install them
# do as much as possible in tmp files.. eliminate POTFILES.in
# then reexplain things in the README
