ASoundPlayer is the base class for any platform specific implementation to perform actual
sound playback.  The derived class is to implement the platform specific code.  ASoundPlayer
preforms software mixing of all playing sound channels (see SoundChannels for details of 
how playback is managed within ReZound).

The derived class is supposed to constantly feed audio to the playback device on that platform 
and get its data from calling ASoundPlayer::mixChannels(...) which fills a buffer with the 
currently playing audio data.

- ??? I suppose I could have ASoundPlayer tell the implementation to 'wait, there's no data to 
play right now', but the cost is not that great
