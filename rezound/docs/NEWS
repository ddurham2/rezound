ReZound-0.1.1alpha
	- Made changes so ReZound would compile with gcc 3.x.  However, one guy
	  has gcc3.1 on SuSE and one file would not compile on his, but would 
	  compile on for me on Mandrake with gcc3.1.  So, I am not sure what the
	  problem is there
	- Made some changes to move toward ReZound running on FreeBSD
	- Suppressed most unnecessary compiler warnings
	- Added check for big endian platforms since ReZound isn't tested there 
	  yet
	- Various minor fixes/enhancements


ReZound-0.1.0alpha
	Very First Release -- The primary goal for this alpha stage is to obtain 
	feedback on what problems ReZound may have compiling on different linux 
	distros and such. Please report any problems you may have with the 
	configure/compiling process through the bug reporting system on 
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/rezound
