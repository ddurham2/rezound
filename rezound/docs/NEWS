rezound-0.7.0beta
	This is a new feature release.  Changes include:
	- Added preliminary JACK support (the speed of and load on your computer will deterine how well this works)
	- Added a "Repeat Count" or "Repeat Time" when pasting from any clipboard
	- Added a "Balance" action which can change the balance or pan audio between two channels
	- Added some symmetry changing buttons and smoothing feature to the graph parameter widget
	- Added a "Recent Actions" under the "Edit" menu

	- Buffer size and buffer count settings can now be made without rebuilding
	- Made other minor cosmetic change, backend changes and bug fixes

rezound-0.6.0beta
	This is a big new feature release.  This being the case, please report 
	any bugs as you might find to the bug reporting system on the SourceForge 
	project page.  Also, I have created a mailing list with SourceForge so 
	please subscribe if you have anything to communicate.
	Many major and minor changes have been made:
	** Major **
	- Changed the GUI to a single window layout instead of multiple windows
	- Added an Arbitrary FIR Filter (plot your own frequency response)
	- Added audio level playback meters that measures the current audio output in both RMS and Peak Levels
	- Added a frequency analyzer that analyzes the current audio output
	- Now Alt-[0-9] switches between the opened files, and Alt-` switches to the previous opened file
	- Holding Ctrl and Left clicking in a sound window starts playing from the clicked position
	- Holding Ctrl and holding the Right mouse button in a sound window starts playing from the clicked position until the mouse button is released
	- Added a "Save Selection as" feature
	- Added a "Save as Multiple Files" feature that can save an audio file into several peices based on properly defined cues
	- Added a "Paste as New" Edit action
	- Added "Copy to New" and "Cut to New" Edit actions
	- Added a "Control" Menu which is mostly for just displaying the keyboard mappings for various actions and play controls
	- Added an action that creates N equally spaced cues within the selection
	- Added an action that creates a cue every X seconds within the selection
	- Added some horizontal and vertical deformation sliders to the widget for drawing curves
	- Added a feature which zooms to fit the selection in the window
	- Recording can be cued up to start when the input hits a given threshold
	** Minor **
	- When a sound is playing the play controls no longer require a stop to have an effect
	- Tweaked the dynamic range compressor algorithm
	- Added a button for recording rather than hiding it in the "File" menu
	- Removed the concept of Right-Clicking menu items for advanced features; now there are just two menu items listed on the menu for such actions
	- Cues no longer must have unique names
	- Made the reopen history size a setting (in ~/.rezound/registry.dat")
	- Added an 'Explain' button to a few action dialogs which hopefully explain some of the less obvious features
	- Added a resizable header to the loaded sounds list box
	- Fixed some backwards compatibility compiling issues with frontend FOX code
	- Numerous other cosmetic tweaks and changes


rezound-0.5.1beta
	I fixed a nasty bug with ReZound crashing RedHat 8.0 with some other specific sound card and drivers.
	Thanks goes to Jason Lyons for detecting this.


rezound-0.5.0beta
	This is mostly a new-feature release, but some bugs also have been fixed.
	- Added a Convolution filter and some presets for reverbs
	- Added a Distortion by a curve action (not complete)
	- Added a Resample action
	- Added a Fit Mix Paste edit action
	- Added 3 Biquad Resonance Filter actions
	- More complete support for raw data
	- Added support for the vox format
	- Added a choice of mix type when using paste edits that mix audio
	- Added Lock Channels to the compressor action
	- Made all the actions cancellable
	- Added a status bar and cancel support when loading mp3s
	- Minor bug fixes and other enhancements


rezound-0.4.0beta
	This is a new-feature and bug-fix release.  I am making this release simply 
	because it has been a month since the last one.  I have bumped ReZound to
	the beta stage now that I've received relatively few reports concerning
	compiling issues.
	- Added a Normalize action under the Remaster menu per feature-request, and it includes an experimental feature
	- Added a Quantize action under the Effects menu
	- Added portaudio support per feature-request (enabled via a configure flag)
	- Added 'cancel' for loading and saving audio files (all except loading mp3 for now)
	- Added some command line support (run with --help for details)
	- Added support for opening multiple audio files with open dialog
	- Fixed the (lack of) redrawing issue while an action is running
	- Created an LFO frontend widget for any action that uses an LFO, now the LFOs have several common parameters including 'shape'
	- The Flange and Varied Repeat actions now make use of the new LFO functionality
	- Rewrote some of the frontend waveform drawing code to be more efficient with X
	- Added a small margin on the right side of the waveform view
	- Fixed a bug where the progress bars sometimes ran too fast hitting the end too soon
	- Added a module for doing FFT based convolution.  I haven't added any frontend means to filter kernels yet, but hopefully soon I will get a chance to.  For now, the Test Effect does a simple bandpass filter using the module
	- Improved compile time a little
	- Many changes/cleanups were made to the code that would not be so interesting to the user
	- Various other bug fixes and changes


rezound-0.3.0alpha
	This is a new-feature and bug-fix release -- As some totally new code now exists
	I ask that you please report any bugs or crashes that you may have.  Please try
	to determine under what circumstances the crash or bug appeared in.  If all goes
	well in this release, I think I will bump it to a beta stage.
	- Added new edit actions: "Swap Channels", "Add Channels" and "Remove Channels"
	- Rewrote the output routing code so that a mono file can play in both speakers; still lacking a frontend for output routes
	- Rewrote audio output buffering code which should make playback smoother under loaded systems
	- Fixed a bug where recording would not work with half-duplex sound cards
	- Fixed some bugs with opening/saving mp3 filenames with irregular characters
	- Added various registry settings at least in the file; still no frontend to change them
	- Now ReZound does not always use /tmp for a working space
	- Added some new features to the shuttle wheel allowing it to hang free and allow it to control slower speeds
	- Fixed the popen bug by writing my own popen which gives me potientially more control
	- Various other error message changes, bug fixes and enhancements


rezound-0.2.0alpha
	- Added Ogg/Vorbis and MP3 file format support
	- Added gain parameters to the single pole filters
	- Improved the startup speed
	- Changed the package naming to all lowercase since debian package must be all lowercase
	- Added a feature so that if the share data directory is not found then it will prompt the user to find it
	- Various other speed updates and problem fixes


ReZound-0.1.2alpha
	- Had a minor but important bug fix about the /usr/share/ReZound path


ReZound-0.1.1alpha
	- Made changes so ReZound would compile with gcc 3.x.  However, one guy
	  has gcc3.1 on SuSE and one file would not compile on his, but would 
	  compile on for me on Mandrake with gcc3.1.  So, I am not sure what the
	  problem is there
	- Made some changes to move toward ReZound running on FreeBSD
	- Suppressed most unnecessary compiler warnings
	- Added check for big endian platforms since ReZound isn't tested there 
	  yet
	- Various minor fixes/enhancements


ReZound-0.1.0alpha
	Very First Release -- The primary goal for this alpha stage is to obtain 
	feedback on what problems ReZound may have compiling on different linux 
	distros and such. Please report any problems you may have with the 
	configure/compiling process through the bug reporting system on 
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/rezound
