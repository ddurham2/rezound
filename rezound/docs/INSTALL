ReZound 0.11.0beta Installation instructions 

If building/installing directly from the CVS repository see CVS-INSTALL

Run 'configure --help' for additional information about configuration options.
	
REQUIRED OR RECOMMENDED LIBRARIES AND APPLICATIONS:

Before attempting to build ReZound you will need to have (or are encouraged to have) the following:

1. Libraries: 

	- libaudiofile v0.2.3 (or later) -- http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/ --
	Development was done with v0.2.3, but earlier versions above than v0.1.9-0.1 
	may work as well. audiofile is available on most distributions. 

	- libfox v1.0.0 (or later) -- http://www.fox-toolkit.org/ -- The FOX GUI 
	toolkit, (earlier version may work)
		- NOTE: reswrap comes with fox.  If you install from the fox tarball
			then you should not have any problems.  If your distro's fox
			package is split into more than 1 package, then you made need
			to install the package containing the reswrap executable.  It
			is only needed for fox development and shouldn't actually have
			to run unless the files in src/images are newer than 
			src/frontend_fox/CFOXIcons.h|cpp

	- libfftw v2.1.3 (or later (not version 3.x yet)) -- http://www.fftw.org -- This 
	is required for convolution filtering, arbitrary FIR filtering and the frequency 
	analyzer and will be required for planned features.

	- lame v3.92 (or later) -- http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3 -- It is recommended that 
	you have lame installed because it provides ReZound with the ability to load and 
	save .mp3 files.  Some distros name the package: 'notlame'.

	- cdrdao -- http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/ -- This is require for the "Burn to CD"
	action

	- libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile and libvorbisenc -- http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ 
	These are required for loading and saving .ogg files

	- libFLAC, libFLAC++ -- http://flac.sourceforge.net/ -- These are required for loading
	and saving FLAC files

	- libSoundTouch -- http://www.iki.fi/oparviai/soundtouch This library is required for 
	the the actions that change pitch without changing tempo and that change tempo without 
	changing pitch.

	- libportaudio -- http://www.portaudio.com -- This can be used if you know what you're
	doing and need it for some reason.  Support for it can be enabled with the configure 
	flag: 
			--enable-portaudio

	- libjack -- http://jackit.sourceforge.net -- This can be used to enable JACK 
	support.  JACK is a really nice system where the jackd server runs and JACK 
	enabled applications connect to it.  Then you can route audio between applications
	instead of being limited in that applications alway do I/O with the hardware device 
	itself.  JACK support can be enabled with the configure flag:
			--enable-jack

	- libpthreads -- This is pretty much standard on all Linux systems' glibc 
	package now. If you don't have it already, It should be available on your 
	distribution discs. [Exceptions: freebsd uses libc_r and netbsd needs libPTL]

	- vox/devox -- http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~tim/vox/ -- required if you want to load 
	.vox files.  This seems to be a quite obscure format, so support would be for 
	rather few people I think.  THESE ARE TWO APPLICATIONS NOT LIBRARIES


2. You should also have a working C++ compiler (g++ is preferred) as well as the 
normal group of regular libraries and headers for compiling packages. 


3. -- PROBLEMS WITH yacc (shipped with SuSE) -- the file, 
src/misc/CNestedDataFile/cfg.y will have problems if you do not have bison 
installed.  I am using some features from bison that yacc does not have.  
Perhaps when ReZound is ported to other operatings systems I will resolve any 
yacc related issues.   However, this whole issue may be avoided if the .cc file 
generated from the .y file is intact.

4. flex -- (free-lex) This is commonly installed, but there should be a package 
for your distro.  I have not tried building ReZound using lex.  Like bison, 
flex should not even have to run if the .c file created from the .l file is
intact.




See the end of this file for information on configure options specific to
ReZound.

If you encounter any errors in the build process and you think you have all the 
required libraries, please send a bug report to: 
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=105056&group_id=5056

If at all possible try to send details, preferably a screen dump or script file.

The ReZound homepage is at http://rezound.sourceforge.net

To strip the rezound binary, use `make install-strip' as the final installation step.

To build a stand alone binary use the configure flag: --enable-standalone.  However,
this requires having all the static libraries that may be depended on by ReZound's 
dependancies (i.e. FOX depends on libjpeg, libpng, libtiff, etc, so libjpeg.a, 
libpng.a, libtiff.a, etc would be required to link.  But that is, only if FOX was not 
configured with --disable-... flags to remove FOX's depenance on these libs.)





Below is the Generic GNU Installation Bit:

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
