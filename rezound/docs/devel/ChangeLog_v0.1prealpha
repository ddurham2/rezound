Mar 24, 2002 -- David W. Durham

I've converted configure.in to configure.ac for using autoconf
2.5x since that's where things are going.

-----------------------------------------------

These are the final changes I've made in preparing v0.1prealpha

Wed Mar  6 13:21:17 EST 2002 -- Anthony Ventimiglia  

Porting for Debian -- Had to remove -Wno-unused-variable and -Wno-unused-function compiler flags because the Debian gcc (2.95.2) chokes on them. 

I wrote a AC macro to test if C++ compiler recognizes flags, which I used to
check for the above warning flags. So now configure checks to see if these
flags are legal on g++ (or whatever compiler is used) and adds them to
CXXFLAGS if they pass.

-----------------------------------------------

Debian compiler also doesn't like ASoundPlayer::mixSoundPlayedChannels() because it's protected. I don't know any of the inner workings, but I'll try moving it to a public member to see if it works. I marked the mods in ASoundPlayer.h

I had to make a similar change with audio_fd in backend/COSSSoundPlayer.h

As per Davy's request, I commented the moves with ???? to make them stand out.

------------------------------------------------

libaudiofile-dev package is too old, so To install it on Debian, An up to date audiofile package should be installed. I'm thinking about including it in the package.  Specifically the afSetVirtualSampleFormat() method isn't implemented in Debian, so we could check in configure.

I wrote a macro ajv_CHECK_LIB_ABORT as a wrapper around AC_CHECK_LIB which
prints a friendly error message if libaudiofile is missing. I'm also checking
for afSetVirtualSampleFormat() since it was missing on Debian. It's an early
version check. 

There is also an option --disable-audiofile-check which will force configure
to skip the check.

--------------------------------------------------

The macro ajv_CXX_CHECK_LIB is used to check for a good libFOX, it is
parameterized, so hopefully it can be used to check for other libraries as
well. Right now it tests for the FXApp class, but once we start getting bug
reports about it, it can be changed to a class that is used, but is new to the
version we require. 

This macro could also be expanded one day if the decision to use different GUI
libraries is ever made. 

There is an option --disable-FOX-check to override this check as well.

-------------------------------------------------

I put a check to test for a native sstream header in configure.in the macro is
defined in config/acinclude.m4. I also integrated config/config.h into the mix
which is created with autoheader from acconfig.h

misc/istring was modified to use missing/sstream-missing should the check for
a native sstream fail

--------------------------------------------------

I moved the sources under src as Davy suggested. It's really a simple job. And
made a common file config/am_include.mk which is included in all the
Makefiles, and I've reorganized the docs directory. 

-------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  8 10:08:39 EST 2002
Wrote config/common.h which will be used to handle low level portability
problems. common.h is included in every header file, so every file sees
common.h and config.h

Put URL's in relevent places in the documentation and configure scripts. 
That's really all I'll do for now. Still some stuff to do, but I think we're
ready to release on my end.
