Add options to manually precify -I paths of -L paths for required libs and
headers. That way if my test fails, overrides will work.


2. Look for other possible trouble spots such as stdint.h int32_t int16_t etc
and set up a common.h header to deal with these problems. 




- might ought to verify that bootstrap is running within the toplevel directory


- when I temporarily uninstalled fox to see what happend it said I could use
  --disable-FOX-check if I thought it was installed.   Maybe you just haven't
  gotten around to it yet (which is fine), but aren't we going to have a flag
  which allows someone to specify an alternate include and link path to fox
  (and any other libraries we rely on)?

- question: why do I have to configure to do a make dist... I understand that
  there has to be the make file.. but does any of the stuff configure found out
  go into actually making the tar ball?
	- I'm not asking for anything to change.. just curious if something
	  about my machine's configuration affects the distro tar ball


- UH OH... I remember you mentioning something about this... but the -D_GNU_SOURCE
  got dropped from the compile line.  It is necessary otherwise you (er, I) get a
  syntax error in /usr/local/include/cc++/thread.h:344 because a certain type 
  is not defined.
