This is a todo list for things we need to do for an official release. In
other words, it's what we'll want to change between the cvs sources and a
distro tarball(eg: removing warning flags)

1. Remove -Wall and all -W flags from CXXFLAGS -- comment out checks for
-Wno... flags in configure.in and remove -Wall from am_include.mk CXXFLAGS

2. Revise docs/AUTHORS to give proper credit, and only list files included in final release. Might want to save separate version to keep in CVS.

3. Revise docs/NEWS and docs/Features.txt (use cvs2cl.pl to determine what significant things have changed since the previous release)

4. Update the version number in configure.in and docs/INSTALL
	- and then do a bootstrap ; configure

5. check any modified files in (docs/AUTHORS, docs/NEWS, docs/Features.txt, configure.in, docs/INSTALL, etc)

6. 'make distcheck'
7. rebuild FOX with all the --disable flags then 'make_standalone.sh'

8. Make a cvs release tag
	- cvs tag rezound-1_2_3alpha

9. make release on sourceforge.net, add a news blurb in the news section, and announce on freshmeat.net
