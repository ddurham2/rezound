This is a todo list for things we need to do for an official release. In
other words, it's what we'll want to change between the cvs sources and a
distro tarball(eg: removing warning flags)

1. Remove -Wall and all -W flags from CXXFLAGS -- comment out checks for
-Wno... flags in configure.in and remove -Wall from am_include.mk CXXFLAGS

2. Revise docs/AUTHORS to give proper credit, and only list files included in final release. Might want to save separate version to keep in CVS.

3. Revise docs/NEWS and docs/Features.txt (use cvs2cl.pl to determine what significant things have changed since the previous release)

4. in po/ to make POTFILES.in-update and make rezound.pot-update

5. Update the version number in configure.ac and docs/INSTALL
	- and then do a bootstrap && configure

6. PROOF-READ ALL CHANGES YOU JUST MADE!

7. Remove any files: rm `find . -name ".#*"`

--- EITHER -------------

8. update the rpm spec file

9. rebuild FOX with all the possible --disable flags, --with-opengl=no, and probably CPPFLAGS=-NO_XIM

10. run build_packages_for_release.sh (which is only local to me -- not in CVS)

--- OR -----------------

8. 'make distcheck'
9. rebuild FOX with all the possible --disable flags, --with-opengl=no, and probably CPPFLAGS=-NO_XIM then 'make_standalone.sh'
10. create .rpm as standalone
	- update the rpm spec file
	- copy the source tarball to /usr/src/RPM/SOURCES
	- rpmbuild -ba rezound.spec

------------------------

11. checkin any modified files (docs/AUTHORS, docs/NEWS, docs/Features.txt, configure.in, docs/INSTALL, etc)

12. get .deb from Anthony

13. Make a cvs release tag (but check in any files that may have been changed first)
	- cvs tag rezound-1_2_3alpha

14. announce:
	- make release on sourceforge.net
	- add a news blurb in the news section at sourceforge
	- freshmeat.net
	- demudi, demudi-devel, portaudio, FOX, ReZound, linux-audio-dev, jackit-devel, etc  mailing lists
		- make sure to put a description in the mailing list so people know what it is
