This is a todo list for things we need to do for an official release. In
other words, it's what we'll want to change between the cvs sources and a
distro tarball(eg: removing warning flags)

1. Remove -Wall and all -W flags from CXXFLAGS -- comment out checks for
-Wno... flags in configure.in and remove -Wall from am_include.mk CXXFLAGS

2. Revise AUTHORS to give proper credit, and only list files included in final release. Might want to save separate version to keep in CVS.

3. Make a cvs release tag

4. Update the version number in configure.in and docs/INSTALL
	- and then do a bootstrap
