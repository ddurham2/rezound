- the $REZ_SHARE_DIR environment variable, if set, can be used to override the install_dir_prefix/share/ReZound path
	where install_dir_prefix is normally /usr or /usr/local

	So if you ran configure as: `configure --prefix=/usr/local` but had later 
	copied the ReZound installed files all into your home directory under a 
	directory called "ReZound" (i.e. /home/ddurham/ReZound) then you can override
	ReZound looking in /usr/local/ReZound for presets.dat by issuing:

		export REZ_SHARE_DIR=/home/ddurham/ReZound

	at the prompt before running ReZound.
