snd:	- http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/software/snd/
	This app has some very advanced features that one may
	find useful, but I find its frontend pretty hard to use.


glame:	- http://glame.sourceforge.net/
	This is a very nice audio editing application similar to ReZound.
	Not perfect, but it's maturing more and more everyday.


sox:	- http://sox.sourceforge.net/
	This is a command line based audio file manipulation
	program.  It's sort of like ImageMagick for audio files.
