** NOTE: 'll_CC' in the following document is your language and country 
abbreviations.  For example, 'en_US' is english and United States.  Not every
language needs a country.  But if you are making a translation you will probably
be aware of this convention.


** To create a new translation:
	- You will need to have a fairly recent version of gettext installed 
	  (perhaps gettext-devel on your distro).

	- At a prompt:
		$ cd rezound-...
		$ cd po
		$ msginit -l ll_CC -i rezound.pot
			- Press enter if your email address is correct or 
			  enter your email address.

	- Edit LINGUAS and add your ll_CC to the end of the one and only line in
	that file (separate with spaces).

	- Now, edit the new ll_CC.po file and you can start translating.  You 
	  should also verify that the information at the top is correct.


** To test while creating/editing a tranlation:
	- After editing and saving your ll_CC.po file run 'make' from the top 
	  rezound source directory.  This will process the modified ll_CC.po
	  file to ll_CC.gmo which is the binary version of the .po
	
	- Now the .gmo needs to be copied under the data directory when ReZound
	  would be installed.  This is '/usr/local/share' unless --datadir was
	  specified when you ran configure.  To copy the .gmo run:

	  cp po/ll_CC.gmo /usr/local/share/locale/ll_CC/LC_MESSAGES/rezound.mo

	- Finally, if it's not set already, the "LANGUAGE" environment variable
	  must be set to your ll_CC before running rezound.  This can be done 
	  with the command:

	  LANGUAGE=ll_CC rezound

	- I suggest writing a little script to be run for testing.  For instance,
	  a run.sh script containing: 

		#!/bin/bash
		export LANGUAGE=ll_CC
		make && cp po/$LANGUAGE.gmo /usr/local/share/locale/$LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/rezound.mo && ./rezound

	  could be run after saving the modified ll_CC.po file to do all the
	  necessary tasks.  Of couse, you will need to make the LC_MESSAGES
	  directory writable by the user doing the translation and make any
	  existing rezound.mo file overwritable by that user.  



Also, I discovered on Mandrake that a package named 'locales-ll_CC' has to be 
installed before gettext will work.  Something similar may be necessary on other
distroes, however I don't know exactly what that would be.

If you type 'locale -a' I think it is necessary that the language you're working 
with show up in that list of installed locales.



** To translate more text in ReZound that exists in the rezound.pot file:
	- rezound.pot is created by gettext scanning the source code for
	  strings in the form: _("..string..")  Not all strings that need to be
	  translated are tagged in this manner yet.  If you want to go looking
	  trough the code for more things to translate just surround the strings
	  by _( ... ) and then:
	  
	  cd to the 'po' directory
	  run: make rezound.pot-update
	  run: cd ..
	  run: make

	- Now your ll_CC.po file should have new entries for translating these
	  newly tagged strings.

	- When adding _( ... ) around the strings it is not always desirable to
	  surround the entire string.  For instance: 

		"Close\tCtrl+W"

	  in the frontend menu should be tagged this way

	  	_("Close")+FXString("\tCtrl+W")

	  because the \t and hot-key doesn't need translation.  FXString is a
	  string class included with the FOX package which has a '+' operator
	  that can join these two resulting strings.  Use 'FXString' when/if the
	  string is going to a FOX class and use 'string' anywhere else.  So the
	  previous string would be tagged as:

	  	_("Close")+string("\tCtrl+W")

	  And if you get a compile error from the previous it is probably 
	  because a 'char *' is expected in the expression and not a 'string' 
	  object.  This can be fix by changing either of the following to:
	  	
	  	(_("Close")+FXString("\tCtrl+W")).text()

	  	(_("Close")+string("\tCtrl+W")).c_str()
	
	  which calls the extra method which returns a 'char *'.


Translation can get more involved than simply rewording strings.  But this is
covered in opening chapters of the gettext manual (especially chapters 1 
through 3) and is beyond the scope of this document.
