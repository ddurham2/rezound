"\n"
"To save a large file (or just a selection from it) as several smaller "
"segments you can create cues that define the segments and then click on "
"\"Save As Multiple Files\" under the \"File\" menu.\n"
"\n"
"In general, cues can be named '(' and ')' to define the beginning and end of "
"each segment to be saved.\n"
"However, a ')' cue (closing a prior '(' cue) can be ommitted if a segment is "
"to end at the beginning of the next segment.\n"
"The very last ')' cue can also be ommitted if the last defined segment is to "
"end at the end of the original audio file (or the end of the selection).\n"
"Furthermore, the '(' cue can optionally be named '(xyz' if 'xyz' is to be "
"included in the segment's filename.\n"
"\n"
"There are several parameters in the dialog that is displayed after selecting "
"\"Save As Multiple Files\" under the \"File\" menu.\n"
"The \"Save to Directory\" parameter is the directory to place each segment "
"file into.\n"
"The \"Filename Prefix\" will be placed before the optional 'xyz' from the "
"'(xyz' cue name.\n"
"The \"Filename Suffix\" will be placed after of the optional 'xyz' from the "
"'(xyz' cue name.\n"
"The \"Format\" parameter in specifies what audio format the segments should "
"be saved as.\n"
"After a segment's filename is formed by putting together, [directory]/"
"[prefix][xyz][suffix].[format extension], if it contains '#' then the '#' "
"will be replaced with a number based on the order that the segments are "
"defined.\n"
"    For instance: \"/home/john/sounds/track #.wav\" will be changed to \"/"
"home/john/sounds/track 1.wav\" for the first segment that is saved, and all "
"the subsequent segments will contain an increasing number.\n"
"    Thus, you should use a '#' in either the save to directory, filename "
"prefix, xyz, or the filename suffix to create unique filenames when saving "
"the segments.\n"
"The \"Segment Number Start\" parameter can be changed from '1' to start the "
"'#' substitutions at something different.\n"
"The \"Open Saved Segments\" can be selected simply if you want to open the "
"segments after they have been saved.\n"
"The \"Applies to\" parameter indicates if the action should regard only the "
"current selection or the entire file.\n"
"The \"Prompt Only Once for Save Parameters\" can be selected if you want the "
"same save parameters to be applied to all files (i.e compression type, audio "
"format, etc).\n"

"   Welcome to this beta stage release of ReZound.  The primary goal for this "
"beta stage is to get feedback on what problems ReZound has running as well "
"as adding a (not-so-well) defined list of features that I would like ReZound "
"to have before calling it '1.0'.  Please report any problems you may have "
"with the configure/compiling/running process to me through the bug report "
"link on the next tab in this about dialog.\n"
"   Features are growing.  I plan eventually to write a brief document on how "
"to implement new actions/effects/edits.  I specifically designed ReZound so "
"that it would be easy to create new actions.\n"
"   If you have any suggestions about the UI or other functionality then "
"please report them also to me through either the support link or feature "
"request link on the next tab.  Thank you for giving ReZound a try.  I hope "
"your experience is a good one and that you will find this application useful "
"when you need to edit audio as I find it useful.\n"
