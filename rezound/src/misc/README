This directory contains miscellaneous files of convenient functionality or 
pieces of other libraries which haven't been incorporated in the main release 
yet

And, the missing directory contains source files which have been known to be 
missing from particular distributions or platforms.  This is where code is 
placed for either a workaround or substitution for what didn't exist on a
particular distribution or platform.

- istring is a  C++ class derived from std::string, the STL string class, and 
  provides some functionality missing in the STL implementation which may be 
  possible with other parts of the STL but is rather cumbersome or verbose.

- cc++/path.* is a class intended to be added to the GNU CommonC++ library.  
  It is used to perform various operations on pathnames (i.e. does exist?, 
  touch, size of file).

- cc++/TAutoBuffer.h is a class intended to be added to the GNU CommonC++ 
  library.  It is used to allocate buffer of memory that will be freed when 
  the object goes out of scope.

- cc++/TAutoArray.h is a class intended to be added to the GNU CommonC++ 
  library.  It is used to allocate an array of objects that will be freed 
  when the object goes out of scope.
