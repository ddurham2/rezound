	- make TPoolFile::accessers (and others sets instead of vectors?) direct indexing isn't necessary, then searching and inserting would become faster

	- I have taken the call to backupSAT() out of TPoolFile::insertSpace because it is just too slow in the real-time situation of recording.
		- perhaps I could have a more efficient way of storing the SAT or backing it up more effiently


	- reimplement TPoolFile::copyToFile to do this: 
		- for each pool, use pool accessors to copy alignment-sized buffers of data from the source to the destination.
		- this way, I don't unnecessarily copy data that doesn't belong to any pool
