This directory is used for the debian packaging.

This is basically here for my use, or to help anyone who may take over
the debianizing process in the future. If you want to install a .deb
package, I'd recommend checking to see if it exists at
http://rezound.sf.net/ before proceeding. However if you want to roll
your own, I guess this will help you out.

If you've never done this before, Don't expect any help from me, like
I said, this is here for me, not you. But if you really must know,
read http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/ to learn the basics of the
debianization process.

As of now, any rezound .deb not packaged by me should be considered
unofficial, and possibly unsafe. Of course being that this is GPL'd
software, you should know that using any of this is AT YOUR OWN RISK.

These steps work on Debian sarge, so it may not work on Woody or Sid.

Here are the steps to making a debian package.

1.	From the top directory run '$sh packaging/debian/deb-prep.sh'
	The directory should now have a configure script and a
	Makefile, and be ready for the standard autotools build
	process. In addition, there should be a distribution tarball
	it the next highest directory (..) .

	You must have the automake-1.5 and autoconf2.13 packages
	installed for this to work

2.	A clean distribution tar ball and directory will now be in 
	packaging/debian/build:
		$ cd packaging/debian/build/rezound-*
		$ dh_make -a -s -e email@foo.org -f ../rezound*.tar.gz 
		   
	You'll have to replace the wildcards above. All relative 
	paths will refer to this new working directory you are in.

3. 	You'll have to make sure the following files are in order
	under debian:

	-- control : make sure the Build-Depends: field is in order. 
	see http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/ch-dreq.en.html
	-- copyright : Check download link
	-- changelog : Make appropriate additions.
	-- rules :

4.	Now run $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
